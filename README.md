## Test it out yourself!

In the project directory, you can run:

```
// 1. If you have not installed Yarn:
npm install yarn

// 2. Install the dependencies:
yarn install

// 3. Kick start the project in development mode:
yarn start
```

If you're ready to deploy the application to the internet, use:
```
yarn build
```
This will build the app for production to the "build" folder. The Built version will be optimized for best performance.
